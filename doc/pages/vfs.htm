<h6 align="center">Note: Zicronix's VFS is still under development, so the factual accuracy of this document is disputed.</h6>
<h1 align="center"><img src="../img/vfs.png"></h1>
The Virtual File System in Zicronix is pretty simple, the application makes a request through applib which issues an interrupt and tells <br>
the kernel about a request, the kernel handles the request by grouping it into: <br>
1. Is it a R/W operation to a device?<br>
2. Or is it a typical function call? <br>
For case(2) the kernel will simply call the appropriate handler and exit, for case(1) the kernel will make a request to the HAL through<br>
the VFS, the HAL will find the appropriate device driver, and will issue a request to the driver, the driver will have all rights<br>
to access the device it's give and will write/read to the device.<br>
